# Official Statement on Structural Injustice and Response Failure

## Overview

This document records a case of structural injustice, violation of user rights, and systemic response failure by [Company Name Redacted]. All facts are backed by concrete evidence, including repository history, communication records, and captured documentation.

## Chronology of Events

1. As an external user, I uploaded observation and analysis materials to a public GitHub repository.

2. I sent a formal email and proposal to the company.  
   - Previously, when I contacted the company regarding technical explanations and GPT-related errors, they responded immediately and even provided internal feedback links.  
   - However, regarding the proposal and official verification requests, the company deliberately **read but did not respond**, despite clear records that the emails were opened.

3. I continued updating the repository, with all uploads and edits **automatically timestamped and recorded** by GitHub.

4. The company **repeatedly suspended my account without any prior notice or explanation**.

5. Each account suspension was **documented with screenshots** and uploaded to the repository in real-time.

6. I issued a **formal warning** on the repository, stating that if another suspension occurred, I would escalate the matter to the media.

7. Despite this warning, the company **suspended my account again**, triggering the process of official media reporting.

8. I formally inquired about the reasons for the suspension via email, explicitly requesting a **written response within 48 hours**.
   - The email was sent with proper records and captured evidence.

9. I also sent an inquiry to the company's legal team regarding the use of the repository, again requesting a **response within 48 hours**.

10. As of now, the 48-hour deadlines are approaching expiration.  
    Immediate escalation to public exposure will proceed unless appropriate official responses are received.

11. **All repository upload and edit histories** are preserved on GitHub and are independently verifiable by any third party.

## Implications

- The company **cannot claim ignorance** of the communications, as read receipts and tracking are recorded.
- The company **cannot argue** that suspensions were justified, as no reasons were ever provided.
- The company **cannot dispute** the authenticity or timing of the uploaded evidence.
- The company **cannot excuse** the absence of a response as a technical error, given their previous prompt replies on less critical matters.

## Final Notice

I have comprehensively secured all necessary evidence.  
Any future attempts by the company to **cover up, distort, minimize, or evade responsibility** will be immediately countered with irrefutable proof.  
All actions, communications, and responses will be recorded and made available for public and journalistic review.

**This matter is not a technical misunderstanding; it concerns core issues of AI ethics, user trust, and corporate accountability.**
